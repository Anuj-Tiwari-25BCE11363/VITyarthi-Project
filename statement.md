**Problem Statement**:

Recognizing handwritten digits and characters is a well-known challenge that appears across education, administrative work, and everyday digital processes. Manual transcription is slow and prone to mistakes, making it difficult to digitize large amounts of handwritten information efficiently. This project aims to build a machine learning solution capable of reliably interpreting handwritten input, automating what was previously a tedious manual task.

**Scope of the Project**:

This project focuses on implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify handwritten images, specifically those sized 28x28 pixels as found in standard datasets. It leverages data from Kaggle, providing a thorough workflow from preprocessing through prediction, and produces results suitable for both competitive machine learning settings and practical use cases. The codebase is optimized for running in Google Colab, ensuring accessibility for users with basic hardware resources.

**Target Users**:

Students and educators seeking to understand and apply computer vision techniques.

Data scientists interested in benchmarking and improving recognition models.

Professionals handling documents or forms with significant handwritten content.

Developers and researchers working on optical character recognition applications.

**High-Level Features**:

End-to-end deep learning workflow for digit and character recognition.

Utilizes a modern CNN architecture designed for effective learning with greyscale images.

Includes data normalization, stratified train/validation split, and output formatting for competition.

Generates prediction files suitable for Kaggle submission or further analysis.

Modular code compatible with Jupyter/Colab notebooks for ease of collaboration.
